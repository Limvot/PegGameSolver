Peg Game Solver
===============

This small Scala program solves the classic Peg Game for any number of sides using a simple DFS.

Build and run this program with sbt, passing in the length of the sides of the peg game you want it to solve if you wish (it defaults to 5), i.e. 'sbt run' to solve the classic length puzzle or 'sbt "run 6"' to solve one with 6 pegs per side.

The result is printed out in reverse order, i.e. it shows the last state of the board first. (read from bottom to top to get each state in order)


Made one night after visiting Cracker Barrel while my roommate wrote one in Rust.
